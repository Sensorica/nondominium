# Project Title

At this moment the project is named _Artcoin_, some have proposed IoA (Internet of _Art_)

# Description {#description}

| We intend to prototype an _Internet of Art_ (IoA) platform that more fully extends the sharing, enjoyment and interactivity of artworks, using _Internet of Things_ (IoT) and blockchain technologies. We are building on an established art circulation and presentation ecosystem, [Soogart](https://www.facebook.com/soogart/), which was inspired from [L’Artoteque](http://www.artotheque.ca), developed by the founders of the Quebec Art Council (partner in this project). [Soogart](https://www.facebook.com/soogart/) is an intermediary agency between painters and venues (residential houses, offices spaces, cafes and restaurants, etc.), where painters can display their art to gain public recognition, and generate revenue from rental fees or sales. |     |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :-- |

We propose a model that desintermediates the economic ecosystem built around [Soogart](https://www.facebook.com/soogart/), using a decentralized cryptoeconomic model, which will provide greater opportunities to artists and venues, and make art more available to the general public.

Objectives

- Effective circulation of artworks
- Enrichment of interactions among artists, venues, art buyers and lovers
- Extended reach and influence of artworks and artists, as the public engages in the arts
- Supporting artists in reaching sponsors, renters, and buyers, as well as in discovering new venues.
- Supporting the public in discovering art and artists

Numerous other valuable outcomes will be discovered through prototyping and operational piloting of this IoA platform.

## ArtCoin for other cultural organizations {#artcoin-for-other-cultural-organizations}

Artcoin can be usable in any context that brings together artists, artworks, venues for display of those artworks and an appreciative public willing to engage with that art. While our pilot focuses on deploying the platform into an urban setting where the venues typically include cafes, restaurants, corporate offices and the like, one can readily envision a wide variety of other settings where this platform can enhance the reach, influence, enjoyment and sustainability of artists and their artworks.

By releasing all hardware designs, software source code and supplementary documentation and instructions under Open Source licenses, the platform can be realized and improved by any group of collaborating artists and presentation venues or events.

## What do you hope to learn in the first stage of development? {#what-do-you-hope-to-learn-in-the-first-stage-of-development?}

L’Artoteque was established in 2007 as a low-tech model for distributing visual art in private and public venues. Artists, vetted by L’Artoteque, bring paintings to a warehouse. Venues chose paintings from the warehouse to rent, with a purchase option. A table sets the renting price, based on the purchase price set by the artist, and sets the percentage for the artist from the rent or the sale or the artwork. Example: a painting between 1000$ and 2000$ is rented for 28$/month, 30% of rent or 70% of sale goes to the artist. L’Artoteque was economically sustainable, at its peak it had an annual revenue between $200K-$300K/year. It also offers delivery, installation, and interior design consultancy services. The problem is scalability.

Soogart was created based on the experience with L'Artoteque.

Artcoin will streamline management operations and logistics, the discovery of artwork, and transactions. We will learn how the traditional low-tech Soogart service can scale using this new digital infrastructure.

Another lesson is derived from the new attributes that the artworks will acquire as an IoA object, as people engage with it (like, share, comment, etc.), in terms of popularity, attention, desirability.

Yet another important lesson is the impact that the new cryptoeconomic model will have on all actors in the ecosystem.

## Background {#background}

Tibi to introduce economic reasons \- art as non rival asset, non scarce asset. New economic model that avoids traditional market failures for art.

## Project audience and impact {#project-audience-and-impact}

There are 4 central participants \- each of which represents, in its own manner, an audience for this project:

- Artists
- Operators and patrons of venues and events
- The general public
- Surrounding community arts agencies

Artists gain increased access to the art-appreciating public, novel digital tools for interacting with that public and a variety of new data-points for gaining insight into the extended world of interests and interactions surrounding and influenced by their artworks.

Operators and patrons of venues and events gain access to local artworks and the associated enhancement of their venue or event with minimal demand on their time and attention because the IoA platform alleviates manual effort and introduces greater security, all at reduced operating cost. They also enjoy greater varieties of artwork and also gain new channels for interacting with both works and creators.

Arts agencies interested in supporting their community artists gain access to a dynamic, real-time datastream informing them across a variety of useful dimensions \- enabling them to address questions like: _Where are artists displaying art?_ _Who is viewing the art? What are they saying about those venues, events, experiences, artworks and artists?_ _How are artists engaging with the viewing public?_

# Progress {#progress}

We are building a partnership, formalizing the project and preparing a funding proposal.

In the technical domain, while we have not designed, prototyped, deployed or evaluated the integrated IoA platform, as described, partners in this venture have previously developed component technologies very similar to those required in the realization of this system.

# Meetings {#meetings}

## Email exchanges {#email-exchanges}

**Michel Bawens**: I was recently watching quite a few videos from the Bruderhof community, and seeing the extraordinary wealth they have accumulated over only one hundred years, something that is quite consistent with so many other communities based on mutualization such as the congregations in medieval times, and I also note a current resurgence of the guild models in maker spaces and such. There must be a way in which artist communities can emulate this logic. See also the AMACCA movement in France, the artistic equivalent of the community-supported agriculture movement,  
**Sophie Jerram**: Rather than dealing with traditional artifact/object artists, it could be useful to start with work that is purely about experiences and alternative exchange. Have a look at the Urban Dream Brokerage site ([www.urbandreambrokerage.org.nz](http://www.urbandreambrokerage.org.nz)) for examples of these kind of projects. In Montreal, I recall the great street comedy festival 'Just for Laughs' which creates extraordinary atmosphere and vitality and bypasses economic turnover measures of value. Does Montreal already have some language and indices to measure the vibrancy of the city?

## Meeting with Heritage Canada {#meeting-with-heritage-canada}

26 August 2020

In attendance  
[**Tibi**](https://www.sensorica.co/affiliates/tibi): co-founder of Sensorica  
[**Chris**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherslaney/): Acting Manager, Creative Marketplace Lab at Canadian Heritage  
**Johnny**: Research and policy analyst at the Creative Marketplace Lab at Canadian Heritage. Interested in AI and arts, from an academic perspective. Leading a group on AI and creative marketplace.

The **_Creative Marketplace Lab on Data, Skills and Technology_** is a team dedicated to taking innovative and experimental approaches to difficult issues in the creative marketplace such as creator remuneration and technological disruption. Current key experiments include the economic viability of creators research, which will try an emerging methodology called “respondent-driven sampling” to better represent the creative marketplace (in collaboration with the Cultural Industries Branch), and skills experimentation with digital tools, testing the effectiveness of online self-assessment tools for copyright literacy. \[[reference](https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/corporate/publications/plans-reports/departmental-plan-2020-2021.html)\]

The **_Creative Marketplace Lab_** takes a convener role for the government, engaging actors in the art market. Its mission is not legislative in nature. Works with the legislative branch, advises the legislative, performs research.

**Most promising funding agencies**:

- [Canada Council Digital Strategy Fund](https://canadacouncil.ca/funding/strategic-funds/digital-strategy-fund)
- [Canada Media Fund](https://www.cmf-fmc.ca/programs-deadlines/programs) (the experimental streams may be the best match)

**John** expressed the possibility of partnering with the ArtCoin project, which he sees as a good case study for the **_Creative Marketplace Lab_**.

Tibi presented this project as an opportunity to build on an existing business model and association of 500 artists, experiment with new tech and its implications on the economic reality of artists.

Questions were asked about how we see the convergence of DLT and AI in the Art domain. Tibi said that this is still an open question, that the ArtCoin project is at the pilot, proof of concept level, that we bring together talented people sitting on disruptive technologies, with a vision of exploring p2p models for art production. We already envision a technological infrastructure that facilitates the flow of physical artistic artifacts, makes physical art more fluid, reduces the costs of transfer of physical artifacts, the logistics involved with changing location, changing hands, custodiAnship / responsibility. On top of that logistical layer, enabled by DLT \+ IoT \+ Verses, we envision building feedback mechanisms, in order to build incentives for art production and distribution, to reward artists and those involved in the manipulation / handling of physical artistic artifacts. These feedback systems work on data about how physical artistic artifacts, where they are, for how long, how viewers engage or interact with them, see them, like them, comment on them, share them, … This part requires AI, to extract patterns and qualifiers about artistic artifacts, artists and venues. Tibi mentioned that we don’t know how all this is going to look in the future, what type of economic model can emerge from this, but what we propose is to engage in a path of experimentation with 500 artists and a talented group of technologists.

As discussed between Sensorica, Verses and the Quebec Arts Council, Tibi mentioned that the goal is to create a hybrid infrastructure that can operate in a traditional way (a centralized intermediary between artists and venues that offers storage and handling / logistics, the current business model of Soogart) and with a flip of a switch can be operated in a p2p way, where there is not need for an intermediary between the artists and venues, moving to a p2p model. That minimizes the risk of Soogart, allowing it to experiment with the p2p model as a side project, and eventually expanding the p2p process as it refines and becomes increasingly economically viable, perhaps surpassing at some point the traditional model.

Tibi mentioned that at first ,we are looking for a first proof of concept, eventually leading to the next step of building an alpha product, and start iterating with artists on new economic models.

Next steps:

1. Continue exchanges on email, going more in depth, explore.
2. John will send links to funding opportunities.
3. We’ll explore collaboration with the Creative Marketplace Lab, and perhaps other academic labs that work on these topics.
4. Identify the best funding source, write funding proposals, perhaps include more partners.
