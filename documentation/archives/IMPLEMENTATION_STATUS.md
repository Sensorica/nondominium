# nondominium Implementation Status

## Overview

**nondominium** is a comprehensive Holochain hApp implementing ValueFlows-compliant resource sharing with embedded governance and a Private Participation Rights (PPR) reputation system. This document provides a detailed overview of all implemented functionality as of the current development state.

## Architecture Overview

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Rust (Holochain HDK 0.5.3 / HDI 0.6.3), compiled to WASM
- **Frontend**: Svelte 5.0 + TypeScript + Vite 6.2.5
- **Testing**: Vitest 3.1.3 + @holochain/tryorama 0.18.2
- **Client**: @holochain/client 0.19.0 for DHT interaction

### Zome Architecture (3-Zome Structure)
The hApp implements a clean separation of concerns across three core zomes:

1. **`zome_person`** - Agent identity, profiles, roles, and capability-based access control
2. **`zome_resource`** - Resource specifications, lifecycle management, and governance rules
3. **`zome_gouvernance`** - Economic events, commitments, claims, and the PPR reputation system

Each zome follows the integrity/coordinator pattern with robust validation and comprehensive testing.
