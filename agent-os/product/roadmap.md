2. [ ] **Enhanced Economic Process Workflows** — Implement multi-step process chaining with automated agent selection and conditional logic based on resource state and agent performance `L`
3. [ ] **Advanced Validation Schemes** — Implement PPR-weighted validator selection and reputation-based consensus for resource approval and governance decisions `M`
4. [ ] **Dispute Resolution Framework** — Build edge-based dispute resolution system involving recent interaction partners with PPR context and private data coordination `L`

### 📈 Network Scaling & Advanced Features
5. [ ] **Advanced Resource Booking System** — Build time-based resource availability management with process scheduling, conflict resolution, and automated notifications `M`
6. [ ] **Process Automation Engine** — Develop automated process matching and agent selection based on PPR reputation, role capabilities, and resource availability `XL`
7. [ ] **Comprehensive Analytics Dashboard** — Deploy network health monitoring, agent performance insights, and resource utilization analytics with predictive scaling `M`
8. [ ] **Mobile Progressive Web App** — Create mobile-optimized interface with full Economic Process support and offline PPR synchronization `L`

### 🌐 Cross-Network & AI Enhancement
9. [ ] **Cross-Network Reputation Integration** — Enable PPR reputation portability across multiple nondominium networks with federated identity management `XL`
10. [ ] **Governance Rule Engine** — Implement dynamic governance rule evaluation with conditional logic support for complex resource access policies `L`
11. [ ] **AI-Enhanced Reputation Analytics** — Implement machine learning-based trust prediction, context-aware reputation weighting, and performance optimization recommendations `XL`
12. [ ] **Community Governance Interface** — Create reputation-weighted voting system for governance parameter adjustment and community decision-making `L`
