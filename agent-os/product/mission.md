# Product Mission

## Pitch

nondominium is a decentralized resource sharing platform that helps communities share physical and digital resources in a fair, transparent, and capture-resistant way by providing organization-agnostic resource management with embedded governance and privacy-preserving reputation tracking.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **Community Cooperatives**: Local groups looking to share tools, equipment, and resources without centralized platform control
- **Maker Spaces & Fab Labs**: Innovation hubs requiring resource tracking and access management across multiple members
- **Transition Towns**: Communities building local resilience through shared infrastructure and resource pooling
- **Digital Commons Projects**: Open-source initiatives needing decentralized resource coordination and governance

### User Personas

**Community Resource Coordinator** (25-65)
- **Role:** Cooperative manager, maker space administrator, community organizer
- **Context:** Managing shared resources for community benefit, ensuring fair access and maintenance
- **Pain Points:** Platform dependency risks, lack of transparent governance, difficulty tracking resource usage and maintenance
- **Goals:** Enable fair resource sharing, maintain resource quality, build community trust, avoid platform lock-in

**Independent Maker/Creator** (20-50)
- **Role:** Artisan, technician, small-scale manufacturer, DIY enthusiast
- **Context:** Needing access to specialized equipment and tools without ownership burden
- **Pain Points:** High cost of equipment, limited access to specialized tools, difficulty finding reliable collaborators
- **Goals:** Access resources cost-effectively, build reputation through reliable participation, find collaborative opportunities

**Network Governance Participant** (30-70)
- **Role:** Community validator, governance volunteer, trust and safety contributor
- **Context:** Ensuring network integrity through validation and dispute resolution
- **Pain Points:** Lack of transparent validation processes, reputation manipulation, centralized control
- **Goals:** Maintain network health, participate in governance decisions, build trustworthy reputation

## The Problem

### Platform Capture and Centralization
Current sharing platforms inevitably become extractive, capturing value created by communities and imposing arbitrary rules. This creates dependency, censorship risk, and misaligned incentives that undermine the original sharing economy vision.

**Our Solution:** A decentralized architecture where resources exist independently of any single organization, governed by embedded rules and transparent peer validation rather than corporate policies.

### Lack of Trust in Decentralized Systems
Decentralized systems often struggle with establishing trust between participants, preventing widespread adoption for valuable physical resources where reliability and accountability are essential.

**Our Solution:** Privacy-preserving reputation tracking through cryptographically-signed Private Participation Receipts (PPRs) that enable trust without compromising personal privacy or creating centralized reputation monopolies.

### Inadequate Economic Process Management
Resource sharing involves complex economic processes (transport, storage, repair, use) that current systems don't adequately support or track, leading to inefficiencies and accountability gaps.

**Our Solution:** Structured Economic Processes with role-based access control, automated validation, and comprehensive audit trails that coordinate multi-agent workflows while maintaining accountability.

## Differentiators

### Organization-Agnostic Architecture
Unlike centralized platforms like Uber, Airbnb, or Tool Libraries, we provide resources that exist independently of any controlling organization. This prevents platform capture and ensures community ownership remains permanent.

This results in true resource commons that cannot be bought, sold, or controlled by single entities, creating permanent community assets.

### Privacy-Preserving Reputation System
Unlike blockchain-based reputation systems that make all interactions public, or centralized systems that create reputation monopolies, we provide cryptographically-signed Private Participation Receipts that enable trust while preserving privacy.

This results in reputation systems that respect personal privacy while providing accountability, enabling broader adoption among privacy-conscious users.

### Embedded Governance with Progressive Trust
Unlike platform-managed governance systems that can be changed arbitrarily, we provide governance rules embedded within resources themselves, enforced programmatically with agent capability progression based on validated performance.

This results in transparent, predictable governance that evolves based on community participation rather than corporate decisions, creating stable long-term coordination mechanisms.

## Key Features

### Core Features
- **Resource Specification Templates**: Define resource types with embedded governance rules and usage requirements
- **Progressive Agent Capabilities**: Three-tier capability system (Simple → Accountable → Primary Accountable Agent) based on validated participation and PPR milestones
- **Economic Process Management**: Four structured processes (Use, Transport, Storage, Repair) with role-based access control, validation, and process chaining capabilities
- **ValueFlows Compliance**: Complete REA (Resource-Event-Agent) pattern implementation with multi-layered ontology (Knowledge, Plan, Observation levels)

### Collaboration Features
- **Private Participation Receipts (PPRs)**: 14-category bi-directional, cryptographically-signed reputation tracking system with privacy-preserving storage and selective disclosure
- **Multi-Reviewer Validation**: Configurable validation schemes (2-of-3, N-of-M, simple_majority) for resource approval and governance decisions with reputation-weighted validator selection
- **Cross-Zome Coordination**: Seamless integration between identity, resource, and governance systems ensuring atomic transaction consistency and comprehensive error handling
- **Dispute Resolution Framework**: Edge-based conflict resolution involving recent interaction partners with PPR context and private data coordination
- **Enhanced Private Data Sharing**: Request/grant workflows with field-specific control, 7-day expiration, and Economic Process coordination integration

### Advanced Features
- **Process-Aware Governance**: Economic process validation with completion requirements, quality assurance, and state change validation
- **Reputation-Based Access**: Dynamic permission levels influenced by proven performance and community participation through PPR-derived metrics
- **Performance Metrics Integration**: Quantitative performance tracking (timeliness, quality, reliability, communication scores) embedded in all economic interactions
- **Four-Layer Privacy Architecture**: Public/Private/Access-Controlled/Derived data layers with comprehensive privacy preservation
- **Cryptographic Integrity**: Bilateral authentication for all participation receipts ensuring authenticity and non-repudiation
