## 🔍 Key Discoveries & Learnings

### **Technical Documentation Patterns**
- **Mermaid Syntax Sensitivity**: Special characters (@, /, &, :) in node labels cause parsing errors
- **Quoting Strategy**: Using quoted node labels with safe character alternatives resolves most issues
- **Visual Enhancement**: Emoji icons and semantic colors significantly improve diagram comprehension

### **User Story Structure Best Practices**
- **Phase-Based Narrative**: Breaking complex processes into clear phases with diagrams
- **Strategic Diagram Placement**: Placing visualizations at decision points enhances understanding
- **Cross-Reference Integration**: Linking diagrams to technical specifications creates comprehensive documentation

### **PPR System Visualization**
- **Color-Coded Categories**: Semantic color system (green for receipts, blue for agents, etc.)
- **Security Emphasis**: Visual indicators for critical validation requirements
- **Process Flow Clarity**: Flowchart layout provides better directional understanding
