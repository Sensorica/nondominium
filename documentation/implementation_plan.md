# Nondominium Implementation Plan

## 1. Executive Summary

This plan details the phased implementation of the Nondominium hApp, a decentralized, organization-agnostic resource management system built on Holochain and ValueFlows. The plan ensures progressive trust, embedded governance, and strict compliance with the requirements and technical specifications.

---

## 2. Implementation Principles

- **ValueFlows Compliance**: All data structures and flows adhere to the ValueFlows standard.
- **Agent-Centric Design**: All data and validation flows from the perspective of individual agents.
- [ ] Progressive Trust: Agents earn capabilities through validation (Simple → Accountable → Primary Accountable).
- **Embedded Governance**: Rules and access control are enforced at the resource and agent level.
- **Capability-Based Security**: All access is managed through Holochain capability tokens.

## 3. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Layer

#### 3.1 Agent Identity & Role System (`zome_person`)
- [ ] Implement `AgentProfile` (public info) and `PrivateProfile` (private entry, PII).
- [ ] Implement `Role` entry with validation metadata and links to validation receipts.
- [ ] Functions:
  - `create_profile()`, `store_private_data()`, `get_agent_profile()`, `get_all_agents()`
  - `assign_role()` (Accountable Agent required; specialized roles require validation per REQ-GOV-06)
  - `promote_agent_to_accountable()` (promotion workflow per REQ-GOV-08)

#### 3.2 Resource Management (`zome_resource`)
- [ ] Implement `ResourceSpecification` with embedded governance rules.
- [ ] Implement `EconomicResource` with custodian tracking.
- [ ] Functions:
  - `create_resource_spec()` (Accountable Agent only)
  - `create_economic_resource()` (triggers validation per REQ-GOV-03)
  - `get_all_resource_specs()`, `get_resources_by_spec()`, `get_my_resources()`
  - `transfer_custody()` (cross-zome event logging, governance enforcement)
  - `check_first_resource_requirement()`

#### 3.3 Basic Validation Framework
- [ ] Implement `ValidationReceipt` and `ResourceValidation` entries.
- [ ] Set up cross-zome validation calls and validation status tracking.
- [ ] Implement validation logic for resource creation, agent promotion, and role assignment.

---

### Phase 2: Governance Layer

#### 3.4 Economic Event System (`zome_governance`)
- [ ] Implement `EconomicEvent`, `Commitment`, and `Claim` entries.
- [ ] Functions:
  - `log_economic_event()`, `propose_commitment()`, `claim_commitment()`
  - `validate_new_resource()` (peer validation, multi-reviewer schemes)
  - `validate_process_event()` (role-gated validation for Storage/Repair/Transport)
  - `validate_agent_identity()` (promotion to Accountable Agent, private profile verification)
  - `check_validation_status()`, `get_validation_history()`

#### 3.5 Peer Validation & Promotion
- [ ] Implement all validation workflows:
  - Resource validation (REQ-GOV-03, REQ-GOV-04)
  - Specialized role validation (REQ-GOV-06)
  - Agent promotion (REQ-GOV-08)
- [ ] Ensure all validation receipts are linked to the relevant agent, resource, or event.

---

### Phase 3: Access Control & Security

#### 3.6 Capability-Based Security
- [ ] Implement `general_access` and `restricted_access` tokens.
- [ ] Apply capability requirements to all zome functions.
- [ ] Implement capability grant/revoke and upgrade workflows.

#### 3.7 Membrane & Network Access
- [ ] Implement permissionless but trackable membrane.
- [ ] Agent joining validation and network access logging.

#### 3.8 Cross-Zome Coordination
- [ ] Ensure all transactional operations (e.g., custody transfer) are atomic and cross-zome consistent.
- [ ] Implement rollback mechanisms for failed operations.

---

### Phase 4: Advanced Features & Optimization

#### 3.9 Advanced Governance & Validation
- [ ] Implement N-of-M and reputation-based validation schemes.
- [ ] Add validator selection and weighting algorithms.
- [ ] Implement advanced dispute resolution and audit trails.

#### 3.10 Performance & Scalability
- [ ] Optimize DHT anchor strategies and distributed queries.
- [ ] Implement caching and parallel validation processing.

---

## 4. Quality Assurance

- **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementation.
- **Incremental Integration**: Continuous integration between zomes.
- **Documentation-First**: Update specs before coding changes.
- **Unit, Integration, and Network Testing**: Validate all workflows, especially validation and promotion.

---

## 5. Risk Mitigation

- **Cross-Zome Dependencies**: Mitigated by interface design and testing.
- **Validation Complexity**: Addressed through modular validation functions.
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: Handled via incremental optimization and monitoring.
- **Validation Gaming**: Prevented through multi-reviewer schemes and audit trails.

---

## 6. Success Metrics

- [ ] Simple Agent can create and transfer first resource.
- [ ] Accountable Agent can validate resources, events, and agents.
- [ ] Primary Accountable Agent can manage resource custody and validate roles.
- [ ] All validation and promotion workflows function as specified.
- [ ] No unauthorized capability escalation; all sensitive data stored as private entries.

---

## 7. Roadmap & Future Enhancements

- **UI Integration**: Web and mobile interfaces.
- **Interoperability**: Integration with other ValueFlows systems.
- **Analytics**: Resource usage and network health dashboards.
- **Governance Evolution**: Community-driven rule changes and advanced role hierarchies.

This plan ensures the Nondominium hApp will fulfill its vision of decentralized, commons-based resource management, with robust governance and validation at every layer, in strict alignment with the requirements and technical specifications.
