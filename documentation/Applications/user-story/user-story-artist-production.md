# User Story: Artist Production - Collaborative Art Creation & Fabrication

## Scenario: Artists Co-producing Large-Scale Installation Using Shared Studio Resources

**Context**: A collective of artists collaborates to create a large-scale public art installation, sharing specialized equipment and studio space through the Artcoin production platform. **This scenario demonstrates both the current Nondominium resource sharing capabilities and the need for broader TrueCommon implementation with full REA integration for complete peer production network management through Network Resource Planning (NRP).**
