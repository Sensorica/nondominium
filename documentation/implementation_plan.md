# nondominium Implementation Plan

## 1. Executive Summary

This plan details the phased implementation of the nondominium hApp, a decentralized, organization-agnostic resource management system built on Holochain and ValueFlows. The plan ensures progressive trust, embedded governance, and strict compliance with the requirements and technical specifications.

---

## 2. Implementation Principles

- **ValueFlows Compliance**: All data structures and flows adhere to the ValueFlows standard.
- **Agent-Centric Design**: All data and validation flows from the perspective of individual agents.
- [ ] Progressive Trust: Agents earn capabilities through validation (Simple ‚Üí Accountable ‚Üí Primary Accountable).
- **Embedded Governance**: Rules and access control are enforced at the resource and agent level.
- **Capability-Based Security**: All access is managed through Holochain capability tokens.

- [ ] Cross-zome validation calls between resource and governance zomes
- [x] **Utils Crate**: Shared utilities for cross-zome functionality and standardized patterns
- [ ] Validation logic integration for resource creation and agent promotion

---

### Phase 2: Governance Layer ‚ö†Ô∏è **IN PROGRESS**

#### 3.4 Economic Event System (`zome_governance`) üîÑ **NEXT PRIORITY**
- [ ] **Integration Priority**: Cross-zome calls from resource zome to governance validation
- [ ] Implement `EconomicEvent`, `Commitment`, and `Claim` entries
- [ ] Functions:
  - [ ] `validate_new_resource()` (called from resource zome, peer validation schemes)
  - [ ] `validate_agent_identity()` (agent promotion workflow)
  - [ ] `log_economic_event()`, `propose_commitment()`, `claim_commitment()`
  - [ ] `check_validation_status()`, `get_validation_history()`

#### 3.5 Peer Validation & Promotion üîÑ **NEXT PRIORITY**
- [ ] **Critical Integration**: Connect resource creation with governance validation
- [ ] Implement validation workflows:
  - [ ] Resource validation (REQ-GOV-03, REQ-GOV-04) - **blocks resource finalization**
  - [ ] Specialized role validation (REQ-GOV-06) - **blocks role assignment**
  - [ ] Agent promotion (REQ-GOV-08) - **blocks capability escalation**
- [ ] Validation receipt linking and audit trail completion

---

### Phase 3: Access Control & Security

#### 3.6 Capability-Based Security
- [ ] Implement `general_access` and `restricted_access` tokens.
- [ ] Apply capability requirements to all zome functions.
- [ ] Implement capability grant/revoke and upgrade workflows.

#### 3.7 Membrane & Network Access
- [ ] Implement permissionless but trackable membrane.
- [ ] Agent joining validation and network access logging.

#### 3.8 Cross-Zome Coordination
- [ ] Ensure all transactional operations (e.g., custody transfer) are atomic and cross-zome consistent.
- [ ] Implement rollback mechanisms for failed operations.

---

### Phase 4: Advanced Features & Optimization

#### 3.9 Advanced Governance & Validation
- [ ] Implement N-of-M and reputation-based validation schemes.
- [ ] Add validator selection and weighting algorithms.
- [ ] Implement advanced dispute resolution and audit trails.

#### 3.10 Performance & Scalability
- [ ] Optimize DHT anchor strategies and distributed queries.
- [ ] Implement caching and parallel validation processing.

---

## 4. Quality Assurance

- **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementation.
- **Incremental Integration**: Continuous integration between zomes.
- **Documentation-First**: Update specs before coding changes.
- **Unit, Integration, and Network Testing**: Validate all workflows, especially validation and promotion.

---

## 5. Risk Mitigation

- **Cross-Zome Dependencies**: Mitigated by interface design and testing.
- **Validation Complexity**: Addressed through modular validation functions.
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: Handled via incremental optimization and monitoring.
- **Validation Gaming**: Prevented through multi-reviewer schemes and audit trails.
