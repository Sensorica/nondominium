# Session: Holochain Development Skill Update with 2025 Best Practices

Successfully researched and updated the nondominium Holochain development skill with latest 2025 best practices using Octocode and Context7. Key discoveries: validation requirements with `required_validations` parameter, link tag validation patterns, Base64 agent keys for web compatibility, and modern validation callback structures from active projects like LightningHOL.

## Major Updates Applied

### Entry Definition Patterns (2025)
- Added `required_validations` parameter to all entry definitions
- Implemented visibility controls (`"private"`) for sensitive data
- Added custom naming options and Base64 agent key support

### Modern Validation Patterns
- Updated validation callbacks with `ScopedLinkType` for sophisticated link validation
- Implemented link tag validation pattern using SerializedBytes for validation data
- Added modern thiserror-based error handling with structured error types

### Files Updated
1. **SKILL.md**: Added comprehensive "Modern Validation Patterns (2025)" section
2. **references/entry_creation_patterns.md**: Added "Latest Holochain Patterns (2025)" section  
3. **assets/entry_types/basic_entry.rs**: Updated with validation requirements

## Critical Anti-Patterns Confirmed Still Valid
- NO manual timestamps in entry fields (use header metadata)
- NO SQL-style foreign keys (use link-based relationships)
- NO direct ActionHash references in entry fields
- #[hdk_entry_helper] macro required for all entry structs

## Session Value
Updated skill now includes current 2025 Holochain development patterns with real-world validation requirements, advanced link validation, and web compatibility options. Ready for modern Holochain development with latest best practices.
