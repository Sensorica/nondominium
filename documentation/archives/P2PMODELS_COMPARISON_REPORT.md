# P2PModels vs Nondominium vs TrueCommons: Comprehensive Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of three decentralized platform projects:

1. **P2PModels** - An Aragon-based organization developing decentralized governance and resource sharing tools
2. **Nondominium** - **Core Engine**: A sophisticated Holochain-based ValueFlows-compliant resource sharing application with embedded governance and private participation receipt system
3. **TrueCommons** - **Pilot Implementation**: A Network Resource Planning (NRP) system that will serve as the first practical implementation of the Nondominium engine for digital commons

**Critical Relationship**: TrueCommons is not just another project in the ecosystem - it's specifically designed as the **pilot implementation** of Nondominium's core engine, demonstrating how the sophisticated PPR system and embedded governance can be applied to create Network Resource Planning systems for digital commons. This represents a strategic engine-to-application relationship where Nondominium provides the foundational infrastructure and TrueCommons provides the domain-specific implementation.

While all three projects aim to enable decentralized collaboration and resource sharing, they take fundamentally different architectural approaches, serve different use cases, and represent different maturity levels in the decentralized ecosystem.

- **Agent Reputation System**: Multi-role reputation with privacy preservation
- **Economic Event Tracking**: Full audit trail of all economic activities
- **Process Validation**: Structured workflows with role-based access control
- **Cross-Zome Coordination**: Complex business logic across multiple domains

### Architecture

#### **3-Zome Structure**

- **Client**: @holochain/client 0.19.0

### Key Innovations

#### **Participation Receipts (PPR) System**

The most sophisticated innovation in Nondominium is the **Private Participation Receipts (PPR) system** - a cryptographically signed, cumulative reputation mechanism that forms the foundation for trust and governance:

```rust
// From zome_gouvernance/src/lib.rs
fn generate_promotion_validation_pprs(
  promoted_agent: AgentPubKey,
  validator_agent: AgentPubKey,
  resource_hash: ActionHash,
  validation_hash: ActionHash,
) -> ExternResult<IssueParticipationReceiptsOutput>
```

**PPR Core Features:**

- **Bi-directional Issuance**: Every economic interaction generates exactly 2 receipts between participating agents
- **Cryptographic Integrity**: All receipts are cryptographically signed for authenticity and non-repudiation
- **Private Storage**: Receipts stored as Holochain private entries, preserving privacy while enabling reputation derivation
- **Multi-role Support**: Agents accumulate receipts across multiple roles simultaneously (User, Transport, Repair, Storage)
- **ValueFlows Integration**: Modeled as specialized Claims within the ValueFlows ontology

**PPR Categories:**

1. **Genesis Role**: Resource creation & validation receipts
2. **Core Usage Role**: Custody transfer receipts
3. **Intermediate Roles**: Service fulfillment (Transport, Repair, Storage) receipts
4. **Network Governance**: Dispute resolution and validation receipts
5. **Quality Assurance**: Performance-based receipts

**Security Features:**

- **End-of-Life Protection**: Multiple validators required for resource decommissioning with 7-14 day challenge period
- **Role Chaining**: Agents can chain multiple actions (transport → repair → transport) within single commitment
- **Performance Metrics**: Quantitative measures (timeliness, quality, reliability, communication) tracked for reputation

#### **Capability-Based Security Architecture**

- Holochain native capability tokens for granular access control
- Role-based permissions with validation metadata in link tags
- Public/private data separation by design
- Progressive access: Simple Agents → Accountable Agents → Primary Accountable Agents
