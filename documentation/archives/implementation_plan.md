# nondominium Implementation Plan

## 1. Executive Summary

This plan details the phased implementation of the nondominium hApp, a decentralized, organization-agnostic resource management system built on Holochain and ValueFlows. The implementation builds incrementally on the existing working foundation to deliver a comprehensive ecosystem with Economic Processes, Private Participation Receipt (PPR) reputation system, agent capability progression, and sophisticated cross-zome coordination. The plan ensures progressive trust, embedded governance, and strict compliance with the updated requirements and technical specifications while avoiding breaking changes to the existing codebase.

## 2. Implementation Principles

- **Incremental Enhancement**: Build on existing working code without breaking changes, extending functionality through new modules and functions
- **ValueFlows Compliance**: All data structures and flows adhere to the ValueFlows standard with Economic Process integration
- **Agent-Centric Design**: All data and validation flows from the perspective of individual agents with capability progression
- **Progressive Trust**: Agents earn capabilities through validation (Simple → Accountable → Primary Accountable Agent) with PPR reputation tracking
- **Embedded Governance**: Rules and access control are enforced at the resource and agent level with Economic Process integration
- **Capability-Based Security**: All access is managed through Holochain capability tokens with role-based process access
- **Privacy-Preserving Accountability**: PPR system enables reputation without compromising privacy through selective disclosure
