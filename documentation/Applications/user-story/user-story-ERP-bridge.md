# User Story: Resource Sharing / Mutualization

## Scenario: Two Organizations Sharing Equipment via an open soruce ERP

**Context**: Sensorica (a maker space) and FabLab (a fabrication lab) want to share a CNC machine through their traditional open source ERP platform integration with Nondominium. **This scenario represents Nondominium's core strength - bilateral resource sharing between organizations - with potential enhancement for broader equipment network optimization.**

### **Phase 1: Discovery & Intent (Day 1)**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Marco as Marco (FabLab)
    participant ERP as ERP
    participant ND as Nondominium
    participant Res as Resource Zome
    participant Gov as Governance Zome

    Marco->>ERP: Search for CNC equipment
    ERP->>ND: get_all_economic_resources()
    ND->>Res: Query available resources
    Res-->>ND: Return CNC machine specs
    ND-->>ERP: Resource with governance rules
    ERP-->>Marco: Display CNC machine details

    Marco->>ERP: Review governance rules
    ERP->>ND: get_governance_rule_profile()
    ND->>Gov: Return rules (certification, insurance)
    Marco->>ERP: Submit AccessForUse commitment
    ERP->>ND: propose_commitment()
    ND->>Gov: Create commitment
```

**Sarah's Actions**:

1. **Resource Discovery**: Marco searches the ERP for available fabrication equipment
2. **Governance Review**: Marco reviews CNC machine's embedded governance rules:
   - Requires Transport certification ✅
   - Proof of facility insurance required
   - Minimum 48-hour notice for transport
3. **Intent Signaling**: Marco submits `AccessForUse` commitment through ERP interface

### **Phase 2: Validation & Trust Building (Day 2)**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Sarah as Sarah (Sensorica)
    participant ERP as ERP
    participant ND as Nondominium
    participant PPR as PPR System

    ND->>Sarah: Notify of new commitment
    Sarah->>ERP: Review Marco's credentials
    ERP->>ND: derive_reputation_summary(Marco)
    ND->>PPR: Calculate reputation scores
    PPR-->>ND: Return reputation data (98% on-time, 4.8/5 quality)
    ND-->>ERP: Display Marco's reputation
    Sarah->>ND: validate_agent_for_custodianship()
    ND->>Gov: Create validation receipt
    Gov-->>ERP: Commitment approved
```

**Multi-Party Validation**:

1. **Identity Verification**: Sarah validates Marco's credentials and insurance
2. **Capability Check**: System validates Marco's Transport certification
3. **Reputation Assessment**: Sarah reviews Marco's PPR summary:
   - 98% on-time delivery rate
   - 4.8/5 quality score
   - 12 successful transport completions

### **Phase 3: Resource Preparation (Day 3)**

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Active: CNC Machine Available
    Active --> Reserved: Sarah prepares for transport
    Reserved --> ReadyForTransport: Documentation complete

    note right of Reserved
        Resource state update: Active → Reserved
        Transport protocols linked
        Insurance certificate uploaded
    end note
```

**Sarah's Preparation**:

1. **Resource State Update**: Changes CNC from `Active` to `Reserved`
2. **Transport Documentation**: Creates transport checklist and safety protocols
3. **Insurance Coordination**: Uploads facility insurance certificate

### **Phase 4: Transport Process (Day 4)**

```mermaid

    Marco->>ERP: Arrive for transport
    ERP->>ND: initiate_transport_process()
    ND->>Gov: Validate Marco's Transport role
    Sarah->>ERP: Scan QR code on CNC machine
    Marco->>ERP: Scan QR code confirmation
    ERP->>ND: transfer_custody()
    ND->>Res: Update custodian: Sarah → Marco
    ND->>Gov: log_economic_event(TransferCustody)
    Gov->>PPR: issue_participation_receipts()
    PPR-->>ND: Generate PPRs for both agents
    ND-->>ERP: Update transport status
```

**The Physical Transfer**:

1. **Transport Initiation**: Marco arrives with certified transport equipment
2. **Custody Transfer Ceremony**: Both agents scan QR codes on CNC machine
3. **Multi-Signature Process**: Bilateral cryptographic signatures executed
4. **Real-time Updates**: ERP shows live transport status

### **Phase 5: Usage & Monitoring (Week 1-2)**
